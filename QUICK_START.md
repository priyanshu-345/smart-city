# Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 Get Started in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Backend Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate data and train models (this takes 1-2 minutes)
python setup.py

# Start Flask server
python app.py
```

✅ Backend is now running on `http://localhost:5000`

### Step 2: Frontend Setup (2 minutes)

Open a **new terminal window**:

```bash
# Navigate to frontend
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start React app
npm start
```

✅ Frontend is now running on `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 3: Use the System (1 minute)

1. Open browser: `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Login** with any username/password (demo mode)
3. Explore the **Dashboard**
4. Try predictions:
   - Go to **Traffic** page
   - Fill in the form
   - Click "Predict Traffic"
   - See the results!

## 📋 What You Get

- ✅ 5 ML models (Traffic, Energy, Water, Waste, Air Quality)
- ✅ Interactive dashboard with charts
- ✅ Real-time predictions
- ✅ Historical data tracking
- ✅ User authentication

## 🎯 Test All Modules

1. **Traffic**: Predict vehicle count and congestion
2. **Energy**: Forecast electricity consumption
3. **Water**: Predict water demand (LSTM)
4. **Waste**: Optimize waste collection
5. **Air Quality**: Monitor air quality status

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**Backend won't start?**
- Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Run `python setup.py` first to generate data and models

**Frontend won't start?**
- Make sure Node.js 16+ is installed
- Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again

**Models not found?**
- Run `python setup.py` in the backend directory

## 📚 Next Steps

- Read `SETUP.md` for detailed instructions
- Read `PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md` for complete documentation
- Customize the models and add your own data

## 🎓 For Final Year Project

This project is ready for:
- ✅ Viva presentation
- ✅ Documentation submission
- ✅ Code demonstration
- ✅ Report writing

All modules are implemented and working!
